# Auto-Paragraph-Generator #
A program that helps you complete your english/history homework.

#### Batch processing of term/definition pairs ####
Tired of defining your vocabulary for us history one by one? Try the batch processing feature. Just enter all the concepts/terms/words you want to lookup and designate a delimeter and let the program do all the hard work.

#### Filtration of invalid sources ####
Invalid sentences are automatically filtered so they won't appear in your paragraph.
